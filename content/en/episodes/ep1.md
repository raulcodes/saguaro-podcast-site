Hello and welcome to the first episode of my first podcast, Saguaro. Saguaro is a podcast about two neighbors whose relationship is more complex than most: the United States and Mexico. I’m your host, Raul Camacho, and I couldn’t be more excited to bring you on this journey with me to learn more about the two countries that shape my identity. Thank you so much for listening and I hope you enjoy.

In this episode, we are going to talk about a derogatory word that is offensive to many, so listener discretion is advised. 
Recently, while researching my families past, I noticed that this word kept being used in research papers, articles and legal documents in a way that was so matter-of-fact, that I started to question what I knew about this word. 

Could this word have evolved in meaning over time?

I was honestly left kind of confused, so I wanted to learn more about the history of this word.

The word, by the way, is [wetback audio].  This word is common enough to be in the dictionary, so let’s start off the same way a high school valedictorian would.

[wetback definition audio].

[Wetback | Definition of Wetback by Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/wetback)

Well that’s a definition all right. But, let’s dig deeper and try to find out where this word came from.

# First public reference of ‘wetback’
I started by looking up the word in a newspaper archive. The first relevant use of the word ‘wetback’ that I found turned out to be from the now-defunct Fort Worth Record, a newspaper from my hometown of Fort Worth, Texas. On Friday morning, February 13th, 1920, an article on page seven reads, “Soviet Ark Captain Tells House About Alien Immigration.”  
[Reporter voice]

I didn’t know what the hell a Soviet Ark was, but the alien immigration part of the headline made sense.

Turns out, the Soviet Ark is a fascinating story about the first Red Scare in America, but it is a story that is best left for a future episode. 

After digging through this article, I started to notice how much of a crossroads it was between lots of different historical threads. 

And at the center of those threads, was a man named Frank.

Testifying to the US House Immigration Committee, Frank W. Berkshire argued that the Mexican/U.S. border needed tighter security, in order to keep out “Japanese, Chinese, and other undesirables.”

It was kind of like that time that Mister Rogers testified at a house committee arguing for increased public television funding, but the complete opposite.

To start off his testimony, Frank Berkshire blew past the opening gate with a different flavor of xenophobia than I expected. At the time, unfortunately, discrimination and outright violence towards Chinese and other east asian immigrants was at a high point in America. Only 32 years before Frank’s testimony, America institutionalized sinophobia with the passage of the first Chinese Exclusion Act. 

Despite Berkshire’s focus on east asian immigrants, he was still able to throw some xenophobia the way of Mexicans. “Berkshire said he would not attempt to estimate the number of ‘wetback’ Mexicans who have entered the United States by swimming the Rio Grande… He said the need for laborers is great, and yet many people feel that bringing them in as farm laborers will eventually build up a great Mexican population in Texas.”  [1]

We can all rest easy in 2021, knowing that a great Mexican population in Texas never came to be, said the son of Mexican immigrants, in Austin, Texas.

I find Berkshire’s matter-of-fact use of the word ‘wetback’ here interesting, but redundant. The definition of the word — ‘Mexicans who have entered the United States by swimming the Rio Grande’ — comes right after the word, as if he was introducing a new audience to this slang. It clearly wasn’t a well-known term at the time, or else he probably wouldn’t have felt a need to define it immediately after using it.

This is purely speculation on my part, so take it with the kosher grain of salt it needs, but it feels almost like Frank was proud of this new word he either learned or came up with. He wanted others to know about this clever little word that could be used to sum up a migrant’s journey for a better life in a way that stripped away the humanity and struggles of the migrant.

My own speculation made me curious about who Frank W. Berkshire was, and how he might have come across the word.

# Frank Walton Berkshire

Frank Walton Berkshire was born to John and Fannie Berkshire in Petersburg, Kentucky in 1870. He was one of at least 6 children. I say at least, because at the time of the 1880 federal census, the youngest child was only 2, so it seems likely that he had more siblings later on. He was born smack dab in the middle of his large family: he had two older brothers, and at least three younger siblings. [2]

In 1896, at the age of 26, Frank moved to Chicago, where he got his first job in the US immigration service as a Chinese inspector. [3] As I mentioned before, anti-Chinese sentiment had become formalized in law with the Chinese Exclusion Act and other legislation that made Chinese immigration illegal. In order to enforce these racist laws, the US Immigration Service began hiring Chinese inspectors, whose job it was to find and deport suspected Chinese immigrants (who may or may not have been documented). 

After four years, Frank found love in a windy place. He married Dora Cowin on October 17, 1900. 

And the birth of Frank Jr followed soon after, in 

Birth of Jr.

Frank traveled for his position as inspector. He moved between Chicago, Brooklyn, and finally El Paso before being promoted to supervising inspector of the Mexican Border District in around 1911.

Frank Walton Berkshire died in year, at the age of age. 

His lasting legacy seems to mostly come from a letter he sent in year
